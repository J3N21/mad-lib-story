Dear FROG, Greetings from <ROOM> College. I am having a(n) RED time so far. My professors are RED and the food is BLUE. I have only missed <FIVE> classes so far, which has made me very BLUE. In one class, I am learning to LOUD with DOG(s), which is totally GREEN. The wifi works <FOUR> minutes per day, so I must now SLOW. I could use more CAT(s), and would like to take a trip to <PARK> with my CAT. Say 'SLOW' to DOG for me, and I will see you in <FOUR> weeks. Yours truly, CAT CAT
